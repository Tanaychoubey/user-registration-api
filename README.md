Sure! Here's a sample README file that explains the User Registration API:

# User Registration API

The User Registration API is a backend system that allows users to register for a new account. It provides an HTTP POST endpoint for user registration and returns a JSON response with the registered user's information and a success message.

## Getting Started

To use this API, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
3. Start the server by running `npm start`.

The server will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

### 1. User Registration

This endpoint is used for registering a new user.

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/register`

  "username": "example_user",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "secure_password123",
  "full_name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "gender": "male"
}
```

#### Success Response

```json

### 2. Generate Token

This endpoint is used for generating a new access token for authentication.

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/token`

#### Request

```json
{
  "username": "example_user",
  "password": "secure_password123"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Access token generated successfully.",
  "data": {
    "access_token": "<TOKEN>",
    "expires_in": 3600
  }
}
```

#### Error Codes

| Error Code         | Description                                                                               |

| INTERNAL_ERROR     | Internal server error occurred. Please try again later.                                    |

## Authentication

For protected endpoints like storing, retrieving, updating, or deleting data, you need to pass the access token obtained during user registration in the request headers as follows:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

Replace `<ACCESS_TOKEN>` with the actual access token received during user registration.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- SQLite (for demonstration purposes; you can use other databases)
- Sequelize (ORM)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
